# CPlayer-Gallery Fixed Version

## Intro

This repository is revised based on [CPlayer](https://github.com/CPlayer-CN)'s Theme [gridea-theme-cplayer-gallery](https://github.com/CPlayer-CN/gridea-theme-cplayer-gallery).

## Modified Places

1. Split the lens and multiverse templates.  
2. Fixed an issue where the introduction bar at the bottom of the Multiverse theme was moved abnormally due to relative positioning when the image was clicked.  
3. Fixed an issue with Lens theme not being properly displayed with Masonry Layout.

## Usage Suggestion

1. If you don't write too much text in your usual articles and don't care too much about not being able to view text on your mobile phone, you can use the Multiverse theme.  
2. If you usually record pictures and write some text, and you need to open the website on your mobile phone to view the text, you can use the Lens theme.
